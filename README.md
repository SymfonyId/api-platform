Dunglas's API platform
======================

*The new bread of web frameworks*

**The framework is still in development. The first public release is planned for
the end of June 2015**

Dunglas's API platform is a next-generation PHP web framework designed to create
API-first projects easily but without compromise with extensibility and flexibility:
- Use our awesome code generator to **bootstrap a fully-functional data model from
[Schema.org][8] vocabularies** with ORM mapping and validation (you can also do it
manually)
- **Expose in minutes an hypermedia REST API** that works out of the box by taking care
of entity metadata (ORM mapping and validation) ; that embraces [JSON-LD][1] and [Hydra][2]
and provides a ton of features (CRUD, validation and error handling, relation
embedding, filters, ordering...)
- Enjoy the **beautiful automatically generated API documentation** (Swagger-like)
- Add **[JWT][25] or [OAuth][26] authentication** to your API
- Create tests with a **user friendly API testing system** on top of [Behat][10]
- Develop your client applications using **your preferred technologies**! Tested and
approved with **AngularJS** (integration included), **Ionic**, **React** and **native
mobile** apps

Dunglas's API platform embraces open web standards (JSON-LD, Hydra, JWT, OAuth,
HTTP, HTML5...) and the [Linked Data][27] movement. It means than your Dunglas's
API platform application is compliant **out of the box** with the semantic web.
**Google will takes care automatically** of structured data exposed by the application
(and yes, Google indexes full-Javascript applications as well as old-fashioned ones).
Your SEO will be improved.

Last but not least, Dunglas's API platform is built on top of [Symfony][5] full-stack
and follows Symfony best practices. It means than you can:
- use **thousands of Symfony bundles** with API platform
- integrate API platform in **any existing Symfony application**
- reuse all **your existing Symfony knowledge** and benefit from the incredible
number of Symfony documentation
- enjoy the awesome [Doctrine ORM][6] (used by default, but fully optional: you can
use the data provider you want, including but not limited to MongoDB ODM and ElasticSearch)

Install
-------

Use [Composer][3] to create your new project:

    composer create-project dunglas/api-platform --stability=dev my-api

Start to hack
-------------

A default application representing a bookstore is installed by default.

* Run `bin/console server:start` and open `http://localhost:8000` in any
  HTTP client to access the API.
* Open `http://localhost:8000/doc` to read the HTML documentation an play
  with the sandbox.
* Give a try to the [HydraConsole][4] client to leverage JSON-LD and Hydra
  features.
* Build your first custom client using Javascript, CORS headers are already
  configured. 

What's inside?
--------------

Dunglas's API platform provides rock solid fundations to build your API:

  * The full power of the [**Symfony**][5] framework and its ecosystem;

  * **[Doctrine][6] ORM/DBAL**;


  * [**DunglasJsonLdApiBundle**][9] to expose in minutes your entities as
    a JSON-LD and Hydra enabled hypermedia REST API.
    
  * [**NelmioApiDocBundle**][24] integrated with DunglasJsonLdApiBundle to
    automatically generate a beautiful human-readable documentation and a
    sandbox to test the API.

  * [**PHP Schema**][7] to generate Doctrine entities (with Symfony
    validation and extended PHPDoc) from [Schema.org][8] types.

  * [Behat][10] and [Behatch][11] configured to easily test the API.

  * An AppBundle you can use to start coding;

  * Annotations enabled for everything;

  * Swiftmailer and Twig to create beautiful emails;

It comes pre-configured with the following bundles:
